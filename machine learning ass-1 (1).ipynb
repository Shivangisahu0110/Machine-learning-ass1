    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broader field that encompasses the development of computer systems and software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI systems can include ML components, but they also involve rule-based reasoning, expert systems, and symbolic problem-solving. The goal of AI is to create machines that can simulate various aspects of human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI encompasses both narrow or weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which aims to replicate human-like intelligence across a wide range of domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following static, rule-based instructions, ML systems adapt and improve their performance as they are exposed to more data. ML algorithms can be divided into several categories, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Common applications of ML include recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks are called deep because they have many hidden layers between the input and output layers. Deep Learning has gained significant attention and success in recent years, particularly in tasks such as image and speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are examples of deep learning architectures. Deep Learning has been able to achieve impressive results in a wide range of applications, and it's particularly well-suited for handling large and complex datasets."
